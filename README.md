# Correlating Edge, Pose with Parsing

This is a Pytorch implementation of our paper [Correlating Edge, Pose with Parsing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.01431.pdf) accepted by CVPR2020. We propose a Correlation Parsing Machine (CorrPM) utilizing a Heterogeneous Non-Local (HNL) network to capture the correlations among features from human edge, pose and parsing.
